# Career Development Reflection

My career direction was unclear at the beginning; however, the career guidance component of the Work Readiness Module was insightful, enabling me to engage in self-discovery and purposeful planning. I was tasked with transforming my interest in technology and analysis into specific career objectives, in addition to comprehending the differences between occupations and long-term careers. Based on the resources provided by the module, I estimated 80,000 hours spent on my career and prepared a SMART plan based on information systems study. The plan includes objectives such as "Achieve certification in information security within one year to advance my career in cybersecurity and systems analysis." I was particularly motivated by Thandi Mhlongo's narrative of resilience, which was focused on remaining resilient in a highly competitive sector. The above process facilitated my transformation from unclear ambitions to a well-defined plan, reaffirming my determination to pursue a meaningful career that enables me to apply my expertise to enhancing computer systems for actual people in the actual world.

# Skills and Interest Reflection

I had always found it difficult to articulate how I could contribute to the workplace outside of my technical training. This module challenged me to examine both my tangible and intangible skills, as well as where they overlap with my interest in technology. Using vocational interest and personality testing, I established a Social-Investigative personality type, which aligns well with careers such as systems analyst and technical support specialist, where analytical reasoning and communication are vital. Further, I identified the presence of transferable skills such as problem-solving and teamwork acquired from group projects, i.e., the CPUT Shuttle System and the Cafeteria Menus application. As a result, I better understand my worth and can confidently assert skills such as systems thinking, attention to detail, and flexibility in pursuing internships or graduate school.

# Personality Assessment Reflection

Before this module, I hadn't seriously considered how personality influences my performance and job satisfaction. The task was to make a reasonable assessment of my interests and match them with suitable environments. From the RIASEC model, I have a firm Investigative and Conventional profile, which is well-suited to occupations requiring data analysis, problem-solving, and working according to established procedures, i.e., information systems analysis or database administration. The work scenario activities helped me identify that I perform best in setting-rich environments with minimal ambiguity. This awareness led me to focus my search on structured, logic-driven roles in IT, away from high-stress sales or unpredictable creative fields that may not be a good match for me in the long term.

# Create CV Reflection

When I first wrote my CV, I had no idea how to highlight my academic projects or technical interests. The module guided me on creating a targeted, professional CV that demonstrates my competence as an ICT student. I employed the FID standard to organize my CV with a clear profile statement, education, key skills, projects, and certifications. I highlighted coursework and personal projects like the CPUT Voting App and E-Campus System to show initiative and relevant experience. I also excluded unnecessary details like my ID number and kept the format consistent. My new CV is closer to who I am as an individual, a committed, curious student driven to progress in systems analysis and cybersecurity. I am confident that it will help me make a positive first impression with employers.

# CV Submission Reflection

In the task of composing my curriculum vitae, I was required to craft a professional document that best captured my academic journey, qualifications, and career aspirations within the field of Information and Communications Technology (ICT). I viewed it as an opportunity to present not only my technical abilities but also my interest in cybersecurity, software development, and information technology analysis. I designed the curriculum vitae to incorporate my current studies at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, and my previous studies at Langenhoven High School, where I completed my matric, and also included relevant certifications, significant projects, including the Online Voting System and the E-Campus System, together with my contact information and LinkedIn profile, thereby enhancing ease of accessibility and professionalism. During this process, I took careful note of the structure, legibility, and general visual effect of the curriculum vitae to make an impression. The presentation of this curriculum vitae has allowed me to comfortably display my readiness for future opportunities, and I am proud of the result, as it reflects both my abilities and my commitment to personal and professional growth.
