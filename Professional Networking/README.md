# Professional Networking Reflection

This component of the module provided me with insight into how professional relationships are helpful for career advancement. I effectively developed and improved my LinkedIn profile to highlight my education, skills, and various Microsoft ICT projects that I worked on during this journey, such as the Shuttle Tracking System and Cafeteria Menu App. By following relevant professionals and alumni, I uncovered ways to learn about knowledge in the field. Additionally, as part of the STAR reflection, it was helpful to understand that taking the initiative to connect with people online would create learning opportunities, increase my confidence in reaching out to mentors, and broaden the potential of my network. More importantly, this experience provided me with a solidified awareness of the degree to which networking is important for professional visibility and career advancement.
