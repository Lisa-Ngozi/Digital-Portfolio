### Business Communication Reflection

In the Work Readiness Module, I came to know how to communicate professionally in both written and verbal forms. I practiced using written forms, such as formal emails, short form business reports, and a short presentation, which all required me to prepare written material. One activity that involved the application of formal written communication required me to email a potential employer about internship opportunities. In writing this, I focused on tone, clarity, and structure. I utilized the STAR technique, and I politely wrote the email, with appropriate headings and formatting. Feedback indicated that I had communicated confidently and professionally through email. This exercise helped to improve my writing and added to my ability to convey technical concepts and ideas in the workplace.
