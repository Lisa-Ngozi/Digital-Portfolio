**Interview Skills Reflection**


Throughout the process, I gained knowledge of how to effectively prepare for interviews by doing research on companies, preparing specific questions, and honing my answers in the STAR format. During a mock interview event, I was asked to answer questions relating to my strengths, working as a member of a team, and working on academic projects. I prepared myself for these questions by reviewing my CV and rehearsing responses that focused on my technical ability combined with interpersonal skills. The lecturer complimented me on my calm demeanor, confidence, and ability to articulate my responses clearly. This process resulted in my developing awareness of how preparation and body language contribute to how well the interview goes.
