# Work Etiquette Reflection

Workplace etiquette training enabled me to understand appropriate behavior, cooperation, and professionalism in a workplace context. For example, during a role-play related to a disagreement amongst team members, I was able to mediate the disagreement respectfully, using effective communication skills. I was able to remain calm, encourage discussion utilizing the STAR framework, and encourage cooperation, resulting in a positive outcome. I received a compliment from the lecturer for my contributions. I learned from this experience that professionalism encompasses not only technical skills, but emotional intelligence, respect, and dependability, regardless of the work situation.
