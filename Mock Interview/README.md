# Mock Interview Reflection

To practice for my mock interview, I recorded myself responding to frequently asked employer questions, focusing on the experience as if I were being interviewed in real life. I wore professional attire, made eye contact with the camera, and answered confidently whenever speaking about my projects and my goals. By using the STAR approach, I was able to describe my ability to solve problems, communicate, and work with a team. Afterwards, when I watched the recording, I noticed many ways to improve, whether by eliminating filler words or working on my posture. Overall, the experience gave me confidence and allowed me to feel more comfortable naturally sharing my strengths during future interviews.
